<h1>Redux Toolkit with React</h1>
<h2>Create a Redux store with configureStore</h2>
<p>
configureStore accepts a reducer function as a named argument</p>
<p>configureStore automatically sets up the store with good default settings</p>
<h2>Provide the Redux store to the React application components</h2>
<p>Put a React-Redux Provider component around your App</p>
<p>Pass the Redux store as Provider store={store}</p>
<h2>
Create a Redux "slice" reducer with createSlice</h2>
<p>
Call createSlice with a string name, an initial state, and named reducer functions</p>
<p>Reducer functions may "mutate" the state using Immer</p>
<p>Export the generated slice reducer and action creators</p>
<h2>Use the React-Redux useSelector/useDispatch hooks in React components
</h2>
<p>Read data from the store with the useSelector hook</p>
<p>Get the dispatch function with the useDispatch hook, and dispatch actions as needed</p>
